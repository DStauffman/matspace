function [folders] = pathset(location, exclude)

% PATHSET  establish desired path, with all subfolders included.
%
% Summary:
%     This functions recursively adds all paths below the input location,
%     or if not specified, it's based on the location of the pathset.m function.
%     This is basically: addpath(genpath(location))
%     However, this function also allows you to exclude certain names, such as .git
%     subfolders.
%
% Input:
%     location : |opt| string specifying folder location [char]
%     ex       : |opt| string or cell array specifying folder name(s) to exclude [char]
%
% Output:
%     folders : string array of folders added to the path, also displays this info to command window
%
% Prototype:
%     % add complete library to path
%     matspace.paths.pathset;
%
% See Also:
%     matspace.paths.pathremove, addpath, genpath, rmpath

% Change Log:
%     1.  Written by Scott Sims in 2008, originally for EKF.
%     2.  Duplicated and updated by David C. Stauffer in Feb 2009 to specify an optional argument in.
%     3.  Moved from the GUI to just one location in UTILS by David C. Stauffer in Oct 2009.
%     4.  Updated by David C. Stauffer in Dec 2009 to pass PGPR_1030.
%     5.  Incorporated by David C. Stauffer into matspace library in November 2016.
%     6.  Updated by David C. Stauffer in September 2018 to use new string arrays, making the
%         function much more compact and easier to understand.
%     7.  Updated by David C. Stauffer in April 2020 to put into a package.
